Description: Make glyphs using pixel-oriented data visualization technique. The package can map data values to pixel colors and order them in a plane in a specific way such as Hilbert curve to get a glyph for each dimension of the data sets. Then, one can plot them in the device. Besides, the mapping from data values to colors has a default function and also for the plot function, but one can have his own function for it. The core of the package is to make a list of glyphs given a multidimensional data set.
